Industry 4.0 however, heralds the greatest leaps in cyber risk to date, as highlighted in a Deloitte paper.</p><p>Advanced malware, armed with zero-day exploits, that autonomously targets vulnerable devices and spreads with little human intervention is likely to overpower an already challenged IT/OT security staff. This disturbing trend highlights the need for IoT device manufacturers to product security-hardened devices.</p></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/sections/three","query":{},"buildId":"sTntk8K5K91YEQmicZeA6","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"head":[["meta",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["meta",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width"}]]}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-555defa4e62ba07d4446.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-64ab8812a1d9fa33f514.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-e067438c4cf4ef2ef178.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.53cfa66f9846f4090096.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/f6078781a05fe1bcb0902d23dbbb2662c8d200b3.e27157e2ae1a2505c3aa.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-406966a37e1d264bc3a2.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/sections/three-0d946fffb81c0bdff1b8.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/sTntk8K5K91YEQmicZeA6/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/sTntk8K5K91YEQmicZeA6/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
