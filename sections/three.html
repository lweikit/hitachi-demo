Still, the pace remains slow and sluggish. A 2018 survey of ASEAN manufacturers showed that only 15 to 25 percent have fully adopted Industry 4.0 and related technologies.</p><h4>UP TO</h4><h2>US$ 627 BILLION</h2><h4>WORTH OF PRODUCTIVITY GAINS FOR ASEAN</h4><p>Then, COVID-19 came and changed everything</p><h4>URGENT NEED FOR</h4><h1>TRANSFORMATION</h1><p>Covid-19 has interrupted production, exposed supply chains weakness &amp; drove an urgent need to modernise operations.</p><p>Telling tales of manufacturers&#x27; reliance on manual processes and operations, coupled with the lack of visibility designed into their supply chains have surfaced. Both hinder manufacturers&#x27; ability to respond dynamically during times of uncertain demand. Modernising these capabilities will be essential for manufacturers to recover from the pandemic quickly.</p><p class="LCD">TO PUT IT SIMPLY, COVID-19 IS SPEARHEADING THIS SECTOR TOWARDS URGENT TRANSFORMATION.</p><ul><li>OF ASEAN MANUFACTURERS SAY THE PANDEMIC HAS ACCELERATED THEIR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION PLANS - 92%</li><li>SEEK MORE EFFICIENT DATA MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS SUCH AS ROBOTIC PROCESS AUTOMATION (RPA) - 42%</li></ul><h4>CHALLENGES OF RACING UP</h4><h2>THE INDUSTRY 4.0</h2><h1>LADDER</h1><p>With a renewed urgenty to commit to Industry 4.0, ASEAN manufacturers are now rushing headlong into technological upgrades.</p><p>39 percent of manufacturers have implemented a nerve-centre, or control-tower, approach to increase end-to-end supply-chain transparency.</p><p>Around a quarter are fast tracking automation programs to stem worker shortages arising from COVID-19</p><p>While the escalated pace of change is impressive, the race to becoming smart factories of tomorrow is marred with three challenges: data silos, lack of skilled managers and cybersecurity threats.</p><h3>Data Living in Silos</h3><p>According to a IDC study, manufacturing data is rarely housed in a common data lake or system, but typically in siloed systems.</p><p>Operators and engineers must manually piece together information from these siloed systems in a tedious and time-consuming process - which naturally hampers innovation and discourages collaboration in a company.</p><h3>Lack of Skilled Managers</h3><p>A McKinsey study has revealed that ASEAN companies suffer from a lack of managers who understand new technologies and innovations to properly implement a transformational strategy, and an insufficient grasp of how all these new solutions can best optimise work processes.</p><h3>Cybersecurity Threats</h3><p>Risks to manufacturers have existed as long as production has been mechanised. Industry 4.0 however, heralds the greatest leaps in cyber risk to date, as highlighted in a Deloitte paper.</p><p>Advanced malware, armed with zero-day exploits, that autonomously targets vulnerable devices and spreads with little human intervention is likely to overpower an already challenged IT/OT security staff. This disturbing trend highlights the need for IoT device manufacturers to product security-hardened devices.</p></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/sections/three","query":{},"buildId":"CngO2Jig4Cvfqcz6heP4_","assetPrefix":"/hitachi-demo","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"head":[["meta",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["meta",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width"}]]}</script><script nomodule="" src="/hitachi-demo/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-49d513b8e73258edd797.js"></script><script src="/hitachi-demo/_next/static/chunks/main-64ab8812a1d9fa33f514.js" async=""></script><script src="/hitachi-demo/_next/static/chunks/webpack-e067438c4cf4ef2ef178.js" async=""></script><script src="/hitachi-demo/_next/static/chunks/framework.53cfa66f9846f4090096.js" async=""></script><script src="/hitachi-demo/_next/static/chunks/f6078781a05fe1bcb0902d23dbbb2662c8d200b3.d87c3fd5c00af5f12061.js" async=""></script><script src="/hitachi-demo/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-f91280bf035c3566180e.js" async=""></script><script src="/hitachi-demo/_next/static/chunks/pages/sections/three-19a6d9af28f8b060f194.js" async=""></script><script src="/hitachi-demo/_next/static/CngO2Jig4Cvfqcz6heP4_/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/hitachi-demo/_next/static/CngO2Jig4Cvfqcz6heP4_/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
