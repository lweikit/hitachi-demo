Industry 4.0 however, heralds the greatest leaps in cyber risk to date, as highlighted in a Deloitte paper.</p><p>Advanced malware, armed with zero-day exploits, that autonomously targets vulnerable devices and spreads with little human intervention is likely to overpower an already challenged IT/OT security staff. This disturbing trend highlights the need for IoT device manufacturers to product security-hardened devices.</p><h4>BUILDING SMART FACTORIES WITH</h4><h2>HITACHI</h2><h1>LUMADA</h1><p>With a firm belief in the ASEAN&#x27;s manufacturing future, Hitachi has taken the first step to set up Lumada Centre, in Thailand in 2018. Serving as a digital services hub, Lumada aims to equip Southeast Asian companies with IoT capabilities, big data analytics as they move up the Industry 4.0 ladder.</p><p>Lumada is an IoT platform that allows you and Hitachi to co-create customized digital solutions to suit your business needs. It offers access to Hitachi&#x27;s advanced technologies through the analysis of your data, which is then used to add value to your business operations through the implementation of big data analytics and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Having worked closely with manufacturers, Hitachi understands that talking about smart factories and data analytics can sound intimidating at first. However, many manufacturers become more receptive after learning how new technologies help to lower costs, raise productivity and ultimately, increase their profits.</p><p class="EMPHASIS">&quot;Modern AI and machine learning allow manufacturers to work with real-time fata from individual components for targeted maintenance. Manufacturers can avoid unnecessary maintenance and pre-empt problems associated with unplanned downtime.&quot;</p></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/sections/four","query":{},"buildId":"OazwqvJXv_Zv2n1O06Q7B","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"head":[["meta",{"charSet":"utf-8"}],["meta",{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width"}]]}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-49d513b8e73258edd797.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-64ab8812a1d9fa33f514.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-e067438c4cf4ef2ef178.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.53cfa66f9846f4090096.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/f6078781a05fe1bcb0902d23dbbb2662c8d200b3.e27157e2ae1a2505c3aa.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-205d783ff7f31f0d39b9.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/sections/four-48422beccb4f57fd3e2a.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/OazwqvJXv_Zv2n1O06Q7B/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/OazwqvJXv_Zv2n1O06Q7B/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
